Summary
The project’s current bots (TradingBot for equities and options_trading_bot) start, run through a loop of tickers, and exit. To evolve these scripts into daemon-like services that continuously trade while accepting real-time user input, consider the following development roadmap:

1. Establish a Backend Service Layer
   Create a new module (e.g., services/trading_daemon.py) to run as a long‑lived process.

Use asyncio to orchestrate concurrent tasks:

A trade evaluation loop that repeatedly calls the existing TradingBot or options_trading_bot logic at configurable intervals.

A command handler that listens for user input (CLI or lightweight API). Input can be processed via an asyncio.Queue so commands (e.g., submitting an order) do not block analysis tasks.

Add configurable stop conditions (e.g., keyboard interrupt, explicit “stop” command, or risk threshold).

2. Adapt TradingBot and options_trading_bot
   Refactor the current run methods so they can be called repeatedly in a loop or via scheduled tasks.

Introduce an optional parameter to keep running until an external stop event is set.

Maintain existing evaluation and execution logic while allowing auto-confirm (auto_confirm=True) to proceed without prompts.

3. Update CLI/Menu Integration
   Extend main.py or a dedicated CLI module so the user can:

Toggle daemon mode (trading or options).

Specify --no-confirm for auto execution.

Submit manual orders or other commands while the daemon is active.

Follow the UI refactoring ideas noted in docs/assistants/ArchUx_02_RefactorCLI.md, keeping user actions separate from backend logic.

4. Logging, Configuration, and Tests
   Reuse the existing logging setup (see alpaca/trading_bot.py lines 31‑47 for reference) to capture daemon activity.

Ensure new modules read from config.py for environment variables such as API keys and tickers.

Update or create tests to cover the daemon’s command-handling and continuous operation.

5. Documentation
   Document the new backend architecture and configuration steps in the docs/ directory.

Include usage examples (e.g., running the daemon, sending commands, enabling auto confirm).

Following this roadmap will transform the short-lived trading scripts into scalable, continuously running services that still allow interactive user control.

Please ask me questions now about what I am looking for and about features I want in the script. Then I will answer them and I want you to update the roadmap and include those.

Here are a few questions to clarify the desired features for the continuously running trading daemon:

Interaction Method

Should the daemon accept commands purely from the terminal (like a CLI), or do you want a lightweight API (HTTP/websocket) so you can send orders or queries from other programs?

Available Commands

Besides submitting orders, what other user actions should be available while the daemon runs (e.g., pause/resume, view portfolio status, modify risk settings)?

Trading Modes

Do you plan to switch dynamically between equities trading and options trading within the same runtime, or will the daemon start in one mode and stay there until manually restarted?

Auto‑Execution Behavior

When --no-confirm is enabled, should every qualifying trade be executed automatically, or do you want additional safety checks (such as risk limits or a “max trades per hour” cap)?

Start/Stop Triggers

How should the daemon shut down? Is keyboard interruption (Ctrl+C) sufficient, or do you want a dedicated “stop” command or other exit conditions (time of day, daily profit/loss limits, etc.)?

With these details, I can refine the development roadmap to fit your exact workflow.

I feel like a flask api would be very useful. yes pause/resume, view positions details, view account details/balance as command. I would like to switch dynamically between trading modes. I would want a max trades per hour cap at least and will integrate configurable limits later. I want a daily stop loss / profit limits. And I want it to stop after extended hours trading and start when pre-market starts.

Notes

The trading bot (alpaca/trading_bot.py) currently evaluates a fixed list of tickers once and then stops. The loop at lines 435‑463 only iterates through ticker_list and exits afterward.

The portfolio manager documentation outlines a modular architecture with components for data ingestion, risk assessment, execution, logging, and notifications.

The CLI refactoring notes emphasize separating user actions from backend logic and restructuring commands into subtrees.

Design Guidance
To evolve the current single-pass trading scripts into a daemon with a Flask API that allows pause/resume, viewing positions, dynamic mode switching, and risk controls (daily stop loss/profit, trade caps, trading-hours enforcement), consider the following architecture:

Backend Daemon

Create a module such as services/trading_daemon.py.

Use asyncio to run two main tasks:

Trading loop that repeatedly invokes TradingBot or options_trading_bot logic.

Flask command server to accept HTTP requests (pause/resume, submit orders, view status, switch modes).

Maintain a shared state object for the current mode, trade count, and daily P/L. This state can be manipulated through the API.

Flask API Endpoints

/status – return account info and open positions (via PortfolioManager.view_account and view_positions).

/order – accept POST requests with order details; use TradeManager to submit orders.

/pause and /resume – toggle a flag checked by the trading loop.

/mode – switch between equities and options trading on the fly.

Additional endpoints for retrieving logs or adjusting risk limits can be added later.

Risk & Schedule Controls

Track daily P/L and trade count in the daemon state.

Implement checks before each trade to enforce:

Maximum trades per hour.

Daily stop-loss/profit thresholds.

Allowed trading windows (start at pre-market, stop after extended hours).

Use the RiskManager for position sizing but enhance it with these new limits.

CLI Integration

Update main.py (or a new CLI module) so users can start or stop the daemon and query its status.

Keep the CLI logic separate from the Flask endpoints as recommended in the refactoring notes.

Documentation

Document API usage and configuration options (e.g., environment variables for stop times or trade caps).

Include examples for switching modes and sending orders while the daemon is running.

The roadmap addresses the features you requested:

Flask API daemon to keep the bot running continuously.

Pause/resume commands so trading can be temporarily halted.

View account and position details via /status endpoint.

Dynamic switching between equities and options modes.

Risk controls such as max trades per hour and daily stop-loss/profit limits.

Trading-hours enforcement (start at pre‑market, stop after extended hours).

CLI integration for starting/stopping the daemon and issuing commands.

These elements collectively cover the items from your initial request.

Potential Improvements
Requirements cleanup – requirements.txt lists many heavy or unused packages (e.g., PyQt, TensorFlow). Trimming it would simplify installation.

Docstring coverage – modules like cli.py and options_trading_bot.py have no module-level docstrings, making it harder to understand their purpose at a glance.

Test environment setup – current tests fail during import because dependencies such as alpaca_trade_api, requests, and pypfopt are missing.
