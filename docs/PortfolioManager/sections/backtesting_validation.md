3. Backtesting & Validation of Risk Models

    Robust Backtesting Techniques
        Walk-forward analysis for live trading simulation.
        Stationarity tests and autocorrelation analysis to avoid spurious results.
        Defining realistic execution assumptions (slippage, spreads, order latency).

    Stress-Testing Risk Models
        Market shock simulations (historical scenarios, VaR analysis).
        Parameter sensitivity analysis to detect overfitting.
        Handling missing or unreliable data in backtesting.

    Avoiding Backtesting Pitfalls
        Lookahead bias and data snooping issues.
        Survivorship bias in equities datasets.
        Overfitting detection using cross-validation techniques.
