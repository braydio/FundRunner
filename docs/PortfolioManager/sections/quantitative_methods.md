2. Quantitative Methods for High-Probability Trade Selection

Probability-Based Models

    Expected Value (EV): Calculate the anticipated value of a trade by weighing potential outcomes by their probabilities.

  def expected_value(win_prob, avg_win, avg_loss):
      loss_prob = 1 - win_prob
      return (win_prob * avg_win) - (loss_prob * avg_loss)

  # Example usage
  ev = expected_value(win_probability, average_win, average_loss)
  print(f"Expected Value per trade: ${ev:.2f}")

    Bayesian Inference: Update the probability of a trading signal's success as new data becomes available.

  from scipy.stats import beta

  # Prior parameters
  alpha_prior = 1
  beta_prior = 1

  # Observed wins and losses
  wins = 55
  losses = 45

  # Posterior distribution
  alpha_post = alpha_prior + wins
  beta_post = beta_prior + losses
  posterior = beta(alpha_post, beta_post)

  # Updated probability of success
  updated_prob = posterior.mean()
  print(f"Updated win probability: {updated_prob:.2%}")

Statistical & Alternative Indicators

    Z-Score for Mean Reversion: Identify overbought or oversold conditions by measuring how many standard deviations the price is from the mean.

  def z_score(series):
      return (series - series.mean()) / series.std()

  # Example usage
  df['Z-Score'] = z_score(df['Close'])

    Alternative Data Analysis: Incorporate non-traditional data sources, such as sentiment analysis from social media or macroeconomic indicators, to enhance trading signals.

  from textblob import TextBlob

  def sentiment_analysis(text):
      return TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity

  # Example usage with a DataFrame 'news_df' containing 'headline' column
  news_df['Sentiment'] = news_df['headline'].apply(sentiment_analysis)

Machine Learning for Trade Selection

    Interpretable Models: Utilize models like Random Forests to predict trade outcomes, ensuring the ability to interpret feature importance.

2.1 Probability-Based Models

    Expected Value (EV): Calculating the EV of a trade helps in understanding its potential profitability.

  def expected_value(win_prob, avg_win, avg_loss):
      loss_prob = 1 - win_prob
      return (win_prob * avg_win) - (loss_prob * avg_loss)

  # Example usage
  ev = expected_value(win_probability, average_win, average_loss)
  print(f"Expected Value per trade: ${ev:.2f}")

    Bayesian Inference: This approach updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired.

  from scipy.stats import beta

  # Prior parameters
  alpha_prior = 1
  beta_prior = 1

  # Observed wins and losses
  wins = 55
  losses = 45

  # Posterior distribution
  alpha_post = alpha_prior + wins
  beta_post = beta_prior + losses
  posterior = beta(alpha_post, beta_post)

  # Updated probability of success
  updated_prob = posterior.mean()
  print(f"Updated win probability: {updated_prob:.2%}")

Bayesian methods are particularly useful in trading for updating the likelihood of a strategy's success as new
