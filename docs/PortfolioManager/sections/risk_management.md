Capital Preservation & Position Sizing

    Kelly Criterion: This formula helps determine the optimal fraction of capital to allocate per trade based on expected win probability and payoff ratio.

  def kelly_criterion(win_prob, win_loss_ratio):
      return win_prob - (1 - win_prob) / win_loss_ratio

  # Example usage
  win_probability = 0.55  # 55% win rate
  win_loss_ratio = 1.5    # Average win is 1.5 times the average loss
  optimal_fraction = kelly_criterion(win_probability, win_loss_ratio)
  print(f"Optimal capital allocation per trade: {optimal_fraction:.2%}")

    Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Adjust position sizes based on market volatility, using indicators like Average True Range (ATR) to determine stop-loss distances.

  import pandas as pd

  def calculate_atr(data, period=14):
      data['H-L'] = data['High'] - data['Low']
      data['H-PC'] = abs(data['High'] - data['Close'].shift(1))
      data['L-PC'] = abs(data['Low'] - data['Close'].shift(1))
      tr = data[['H-L', 'H-PC', 'L-PC']].max(axis=1)
      atr = tr.rolling(window=period).mean()
      return atr

  # Example usage with a DataFrame 'df' containing 'High', 'Low', 'Close' columns
  df['ATR'] = calculate_atr(df)

Managing Drawdowns & Risk-Adjusted Returns

    Maximum Drawdown (MDD): Measure the largest peak-to-trough decline in your portfolio to assess risk.

  def max_drawdown(returns):
      cumulative = (1 + returns).cumprod()
      peak = cumulative.cummax()
      drawdown = (cumulative - peak) / peak
      return drawdown.min()

  # Example usage with a pandas Series 'returns'
  mdd = max_drawdown(returns)
  print(f"Maximum Drawdown: {mdd:.2%}")

    Sharpe Ratio: Evaluate risk-adjusted returns by comparing the portfolio return to the risk-free rate, adjusted for volatility.

  def sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.01):
      excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate / 252
      return excess_returns.mean() / returns.std() * (252 ** 0.5)

  # Example usage with daily returns
  sharpe = sharpe_ratio(returns)
  print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe:.2f}")

Modern Risk Control Techniques

    Volatility Targeting: Adjust exposure to maintain consistent portfolio volatility, scaling positions inversely with market volatility.

  target_volatility = 0.02  # Target daily volatility (e.g., 2%)
  current_volatility = returns.std()
  scaling_factor = target_volatility / current_volatility
  adjusted_positions = original_positions * scaling_factor

    Beta Hedging: Mitigate market risk by hedging positions based on their beta, aligning portfolio beta to a desired level.

  portfolio_beta = sum(position['beta'] * position['value'] for position in portfolio) / total_portfolio_value
  desired_beta = 1.0  # Neutral market exposure
  hedge_ratio = (portfolio_beta - desired_beta) / market_beta

1.1 Capital Preservation & Position Sizing

    Kelly Criterion: While the Kelly Criterion offers an optimal formula for capital allocation, it can lead to aggressive position sizes. A more conservative approach involves using a fraction of the Kelly value to balance growth and risk.

  def fractional_kelly(win_prob, win_loss_ratio, fraction=0.5):
      kelly_fraction = win_prob - (1 - win_prob) / win_loss_ratio
      return fraction * kelly_fraction

  # Example usage
  win_probability = 0.55  # 55% win rate
  win_loss_ratio = 1.5    # Average win is 1.5 times the average loss
  optimal_fraction = fractional_kelly(win_probability, win_loss_ratio)
  print(f"Optimal capital allocation per trade: {optimal_fraction:.2%}")

    Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Adjusting position sizes based on volatility helps in managing risk. The Average True Range (ATR) is a commonly used indicator for this purpose.

  import pandas as pd

  def calculate_atr(data, period=14):
      data['H-L'] = data['High'] - data['Low']
      data['H-PC'] = abs(data['High'] - data['Close'].shift(1))
      data['L-PC'] = abs(data['Low'] - data['Close'].shift(1))
      tr = data[['H-L', 'H-PC', 'L-PC']].max(axis=1)
      atr = tr.rolling(window=period).mean()
      return atr

  # Example usage with a DataFrame 'df' containing 'High', 'Low', 'Close' columns
  df['ATR'] = calculate_atr(df)

1.2 Managing Drawdowns & Risk-Adjusted Returns

    Maximum Drawdown (MDD): Monitoring MDD is crucial for understanding potential losses.

  def max_drawdown(returns):
      cumulative = (1 + returns).cumprod()
      peak = cumulative.cummax()
      drawdown = (cumulative - peak) / peak
      return drawdown.min()

  # Example usage with a pandas Series 'returns'
  mdd = max_drawdown(returns)
  print(f"Maximum Drawdown: {mdd:.2%}")

    Sharpe Ratio: This ratio helps in assessing risk-adjusted returns.

  def sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.01):
      excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate / 252
      return excess_returns.mean() / returns.std() * (252 ** 0.5)

  # Example usage with daily returns
  sharpe = sharpe_ratio(returns)
  print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe:.2f}")

1.3 Modern Risk Control Techniques

    Value at Risk (VaR): VaR estimates the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.

  import numpy as np

  def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95):
      if isinstance(returns, pd.Series):
          returns = returns.dropna().values
      sorted_returns = np.sort(returns)
      index = int((1 - confidence_level) * len(sorted_returns))
      return abs(sorted_returns[index])

  # Example usage
  var_95 = calculate_var(returns, 0.95)
  print(f"95% Value at Risk: {var_95:.2%}")

While VaR provides an estimate of potential losses, it's essential to complement it with other risk measures due to its limitations, such as not accounting for extreme events.

    Monte Carlo Simulations: These simulations model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables.

  import numpy as np

  def monte_carlo_simulation(start_price, days, mu, sigma, num_simulations):
      simulations = []
      for _ in range(num_simulations):
          prices = [start_price]
          for _ in range(days):
              prices.append(prices[-1] * np.exp(np.random.normal(mu, sigma)))
          simulations.append(prices)
      return np.array(simulations)

  # Example usage
  simulations = monte_carlo_simulation(start_price=100, days=252, mu=0.0005, sigma=0.01, num_simulations=1000)

Monte Carlo simulations can provide a range of possible outcomes and help in assessing the robustness of a trading strategy under different market conditions.
