# LLM-Driven Options Sentiment & Backtesting Pipeline (Future Roadmap)

## Goals

- Use a local LLM to perform deep per-metric and aggregate analysis of options chains for a given symbol.
- Assess sentiment and market expectation not just from pattern/number, but from contextual language model reasoning.
- Backtest LLM verdicts versus actual market outcomes.

## LLM Multi-Metric Sentiment Flow

1. **Data Aggregation**:

   - For each symbol, collect metrics:
     - open_interest, volume, put_call_ratio, iv_rank, iv_percentile, max_pain, unusual_activity_score, skew, gamma_exposure, largest_trade_size
   - Optionally: add news/headlines/context.

2. **Metric-Level Analysis:**

   - For each metric, generate a prompt to the local LLM:
     - “Given the open interest is 10,000, and volume is 20,000, what does this mean for sentiment?”
     - Log/store each LLM response per metric.

3. **Aggregate Analysis:**
   - After all metrics are processed, prompt the LLM to review all summaries and output an aggregate sentiment and expected move.

## Backtesting Flow

1. **For a given historical date (or window):**

   - Collect actual options metrics, run full LLM analysis as above.
   - Save LLM’s predicted sentiment and expected move (bullish, bearish, neutral, direction, rationale).

2. **Collect Actual Market Movement:**

   - Track price movement for the symbol post-prediction (e.g., 1 day/5 day/10 day returns).
   - Compare LLM-predicted move to real move.

3. **Scoring/Validation:**
   - Record accuracy of LLM predictions.
   - Optionally: aggregate over many symbols/dates for statistical significance.

## Notes

- This research aims to validate if LLMs can extract subtle, real-world signals from raw options data.
- All prompts/LLM outputs and actual price outcomes should be logged for transparency and review.
- Future: Expand metrics, integrate news sentiment, experiment with different prompt strategies, enable dashboard visualizations.

**Next Steps:**

- Finish plugin.
- Implement backtesting loop.
- Document sample results.
