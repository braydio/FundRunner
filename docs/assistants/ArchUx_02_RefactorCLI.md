# ArchUx_02_RefactorCLI

- Rewrite `cli.py` into structured subtrees (user, view, edit, etc.)
- Confirm current chainnes and selected profiles at run-time
- Remove parallel dependencies from core routines
- Ensure commands are composable as provided by the UP cli description
- Separate user actions from the backend logic
Relates to future commands: register,authorize, init data tables.
