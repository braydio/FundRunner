## Introduction

This document serves as a deep research prompt to guide the design of a robust, adaptive, and scalable **Portfolio Management Trading Bot** using the [Alpaca Markets API](https://alpaca.markets/). The bot will be **sector-focused** and can handle both **stocks and options**, adjusting allocations based on **risk-weighted analysis** and **macroeconomic conditions**—prioritizing strategic rebalancing over frequent, reactive trades.

---

## Key Features & Strategy

### Sector Balance & Dynamic Allocation
- Maintain exposure across multiple sectors (e.g., **tech**, **healthcare**, **financials**, **energy**).
- Adjust allocations dynamically based on **performance**, **volatility**, and **macro conditions**.
- **Toggle** between **mean reversion** vs. **trend-following** allocation strategies.

### Risk-Based Adjustments (Threshold-Driven Execution)
- Leverage multiple **risk analysis methods** (e.g., **Sharpe ratio**, **Value at Risk (VaR)**, volatility metrics).
- Weighted scoring method: **Only execute trades** if the total weighted risk score crosses a predefined threshold.
- Incorporate **historical drawdowns**, **earnings data**, and **macroeconomic trends** in the risk assessment.

### Rebalancing Frequency
- Optimal **biweekly to monthly** rebalancing, with dynamic frequency based on market conditions.
- Dynamically **increase or decrease cash holdings** depending on market uncertainty.

### Market Condition Awareness
- Adjust allocations based on **VIX**, **interest rates**, **GDP trends**, and **earnings reports**.
- Consider **pausing or reducing exposure** around **FOMC events**, **CPI releases**, or other major economic announcements.

### Alpaca API Integration & Execution
- Automate rebalancing and execute orders using **limit**, **stop-limit**, and **market orders**.
- Fetch **real-time sector performance**, **volatility**, and **macroeconomic indicators**.
- Consider **alternative data sources** (e.g., earnings sentiment, news sentiment) for enhanced insights.

### Performance Tracking & Alerts
- Store **portfolio changes**, **PnL**, **risk metrics**, and **trade logs** in a database.
- Send alerts to **Discord**, **Telegram**, or **email** when **allocations change**.

### Backtesting & Optimization
- Include **historical backtesting** to compare **mean reversion** vs. **trend-following**.
- Incorporate **slippage** and **execution differences** between **backtest** and **live trading**.

---

## Technical Requirements & Deployment
- **Language:** Python
- **Deployment:** Containerized (Docker) with cloud support (e.g., **AWS**, **Linode**, or local execution)
- **Execution Speed:** Prioritize **quality fills** over ultra-low-latency strategies.
- **User Controls:**
  - **Manual toggle** for mean reversion vs. trend-following.
  - **User-defined risk weighting factors** and threshold for trade execution.

---

## Detailed Design & Considerations

### Data Sources & Frequency
- Define **intraday**, **daily**, or **weekly** data ingestion from macroeconomic and market data feeds.
- Explore **third-party** or **native Alpaca** data endpoints for fundamental data.
- Optionally integrate **alternative data** (news sentiment, social media sentiment, earnings announcements).

### Position Sizing & Leverage Constraints
- Specify whether to allow **leverage**, **short positions**, or advanced **option strategies** (e.g., multi-leg positions).
- Integrate max **drawdown constraints** or a risk budget for each sector.

### Error Handling & Fallback Logic
- Implement robust handling for **API failures**, **rate limits**, or **network issues**.
- Define safe fallback (e.g., increase cash allocation, halt trades) if data feed or risk calculations are compromised.

### Scheduling & Automation
- Schedule monthly/biweekly tasks via **cron**, **cloud scheduler**, or **continuous** event-based triggers.
- Adjust scheduling frequency based on **volatility spikes** or **major market events**.

### Compliance & Paper Trading
- Leverage **Alpaca paper-trading** environment for safe testing.
- Integrate compliance checks if applicable (e.g., pattern day trading constraints, short-selling constraints).

### Code & Architecture Examples
- Consider using a **microservices** or **modular** architecture:
  1. **Data Ingestion Module** (market data, alternative data)
  2. **Risk Assessment Module** (Sharpe, VaR, volatility, etc.)
  3. **Allocation Engine** (sector weighting, mean reversion/trend-following logic)
  4. **Execution Module** (Alpaca integration, order handling)
  5. **Reporting & Alert Module** (PnL, logs, notifications)
- Use frameworks like **Backtrader**, **Zipline**, or custom scripts for backtesting.

## Prompt Add-On Suggestions
1. **Pseudocode & Architecture**: _“Please provide a Python-based architecture breakdown with function stubs for each module.”_
2. **Scheduling & Deployment**: _“Outline a Docker + AWS-based deployment process, including CI/CD pipeline and automated triggers.”_
3. **Risk Model Examples**: _“Give an example of how Sharpe ratio and VaR would be computed and integrated into the allocation logic.”_
4. **Backtesting Approach**: _“Propose a backtesting structure to compare mean reversion vs. trend-following, addressing transaction costs and slippage.”_

## Conclusion

This deep research prompt provides a **comprehensive roadmap** for designing a portfolio management trading bot on **Alpaca Markets**. By combining **sector-based diversification**, **risk-weighted threshold execution**, **macro-awareness**, and **flexible rebalancing**, the bot can offer a **robust**, **adaptive**, and **scalable** approach. For best results, **iterate** on each section—architecture, data sources, scheduling, and risk management—to create a **well-tested** and **resilient** trading system.
